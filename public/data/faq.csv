What is the tracking set up for Seedtag Performance,At least one tracking per size + 1 per strategy. We activate at least 4 strategies and we recommend 8 different sizes (4 x 8 = 20 is the minimum amount of trackers we recommend).,Trackings,"Pixel setup, trackers"
difference between trackers and tags ,"We use ""tag"" or ""tracker"" indistinctly. We should recognice the different trackings (redirect, impressions tracker, click command, 3rd party verificator impression pixels, wrapped redirect, etc.) and also the urls with utms. See more info in ""additional Info below the questions).
",Trackings,"trackers, tags"
is it necessary to receive different trackings when KPI is CTR/delivery? ,"It's always a recomendation have different trackers is we should measure the succeess of the campaign with the client data. Have different trackings is the only way to split the info by strategy/size, etc on the client's adserver/GA report.",Trackings,trackers
is it possible to optimize with 4-5 trackers per motive? ,"What do you mean per motive?? Resivar comentar la diferencia entre size, creatividad y estrategia",Trackings,trackers
is it mandatory to receive different trackings per size?,"It's not mandatory, but we need to receive trackings split by size and strategy if the success of the campaign will be measured with the client's adserver or GA. It's the way we have to split the data as we can see it on the DSP and optimize the campaign properly.
",Trackings,
How many trackers would we need if the campaign has both formats and have the same KPI?,"One per size x Strategy x Format. So we'll have 8 sizes x 4 strategies x 2 formats. This is our recommendation, but we can activate the campaign using the same trackers if the objective (for example) is delivery and we don't need to report any data split by format. (When we talked about ""both formats"" here we talk about CPD and CND).",Trackings,
How many trackers would we need if the campaign has both formats and have the different KPI?,"If the campaign has 2 formats and 2 different KPIs, then we should have 2 different Jira tkt, 2 different campaigns on the DSP and different trackers per format, size and strategy.",Trackings,
Do we need any different number of trackings and type of trackings depending on the adserver client has?,"No, every adserver is the same for us, also GA works ""same way"". If the data will be measured by an adserver we need at least > 8 sizes x 4 strategies; if the data will be measured by GA we need the urls with utms, at least > 8 sizes x 4 strategies.",Trackings,
Do we need the impression tracker and click tracker for all the campaigns?,"No, we need both if the client wants to measure both metrics on the adserver. If they only want to measure clicks, we can work with the click tracker. If the campaign has a lead objective, we can't measure the post view conversions if we don't have the impression pixel implemented.",Trackings,
How many events/conversions can we accurately track within a site?,We can track as many events/conversions we need if we can implement all the pixels to measure them. 1 event/conversion = 1 pixel.,Trackings,
Should we receive different trackers per strategy or only per size?,We should receive different trrackers per strategy and per size if we need to measure the success of the campaign with the data from the client so we can optimise all the dimensions on the DSP with this data.,Trackings,
What is the added value of an impression tracker vs a click tracker?,"The impression tracker traces impressions, the click tracker traces clicks. Both metrics are different and add value to the client if the client needs to report both. They need both metrics if they want to calculate the CTR with the adserver DSP, so we'll need to implement both trackers on the creatives. Also if the objective is ""visits"" or ""leads"" measured by our pixel, if we have both trackers we can trace post clicks and post impression conversions.",Trackings,
What are the different tag types we have ?,We have 4 different types available and more information on that can be found here  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqXnffdRGNE02rHeAEpq252r1FE-NWMWEnxJzhMilWM/edit#gid=0,Trackings,"Tags, Links"
Are conversions measured Post click or post view? ,"It depends. If we have urls with utms the activity is measured by GA, then all the activity is measured only post click. If we have our pixels implemented on the client web page, activity post click and post view are measured. If the client shares the Attribution Window applied on the adserverd, we can modify it on the DSP and the attribution can be only post click, only post view or both.",Attribution,
What is the default cookie time/tracking period? ,??? this question is about the attribution window or about the max time que can see the cookies??,Attribution,
What is the attribution window? Do we agree on it with the client or do we use a standard 30/7,The Attribution Window is the time frame a hit is considered as a conversion on the client's adserver or the DSP. We prefer to apply the client's attribution window so we can see similar data than them.,Attribution,
We keep receiving inquiries about whether our performance solution is available programmatically,??? Review the explanation of pregrammatic in Seedtag ( review with product),Attribution,
What is our current attribution window and what is the least amount of days we should obtain?,We don't have a minimun amount of days. We modify it with the client's info we have and if the client measures the campaign performance by adserver or GA. By default the AT on the DSP in 90/90. We always adapt it to the adserver's client AT or if the client uses GA post view always be 0(because only the post click activity is tracked).,Attribution,
Difference between Sesion (GA) and clicks,Click is the user's action that happens on the creative. The Session is measured by GA and happens once the user spends a few seconds on the client web page after accepting the Cookie Policy. Clicks and Session can't me used as a similar metrics.,Attribution,Measurement
Difference between hits and conversions on a DSP pixel,"A ""hit"" is equal to a ""firing"" on the LP. The conversion is attributed by the DSP and the adserver once the attribution model is applied (the attribution window, the number of strategies on the DSP, the number of publishers, the way the pixel is implemented - by publisher or by default and many more variables counts).",Attribution,
Pixel implemente by Default vs by Publisher,The client can implement our pixel on the page measuing all the activity (for example: firing everytime that an user visit the LP or only when the user visit the LP after watch our banner or click on it).,Attribution,
How should creatives be shared with Seedtag? ,"The creatives can be shared in a redirect, which means that the client allocated the creative on its adserver and we have a code, an HTML5, or they can share the assets with the AM and the AM should create a request to the Design team.",Creatives,
How can we work with html5 banners??,"We can upload the HTML5 to the DSP, but the client needs to include inside the zip file all the assets and the code to render the creative and also the impressions and click tracker.",Creatives,
What are the formats/options of the creatives that we can go live with ,pte review question,Creatives,
Is there a specific creative size that perfroms better than the rest usually ?! ,"Since we run the campaigns on mobile, desktop and tablet we always recommend having the 8 standard sizes, so we can optimise per device and size.",Creatives,
Can we work with the sizes that the client share with us although we donÂ´t have them ? ,"We don't have sizes. We run the campaigns in open and we can upload all the sizes to the DSP. But the recommendation is always to ask for the sizes approved by the IAB and the standard ones all the publishers have as a placemment. If the size doesn't match any market size, we won't have anu inventory available.",Creatives,
Can we use a video creative?,"We can't run Video creatives with a Performance objective. The main purpose of a video creative is to get a complete view of the video content, not drive actions to the client's LP.",Creatives,
Can we work with our own creatives? ,Some test have started since January in some markets. We'll keep you posted! :),Creatives,
What is the best way to implement pixels? Through existing Floodlights or another way? ,The clients can implement pixels on Floodlights or directly in the web code. With the second one we have more visibility and more flexibility to create triggers to define events. But both of them work.,Pixels,
Why do we need pixels? ,"We need to implement pixels if the campaign objective is anything on the web page so we can measure and optimise the event/conversion. Pixels from the DSP are the only way we can ""see"" the data on the DSP and push the algorithm to achieve a specific goal.",Pixels,
Can we work with our own creatives? ,"Question moved to ""creatives Tab (already asnwered in creatives tab, delete?)",Pixels,
what can we share when the client asks for pixel legacies? ,"By default we share JS pixels but are limited to the clients who can use them, if not, we could use img. aree you referring to this as ""legacy pixels""?",Pixels,
what kind of information is safed / used within our pixel?,"The pixels form a DSP only can save ""hits"" during a period . That means that we only ""record"" the amount of times the pixel jumps in a specific part of the LP or event. We can also add some macros to measure for example revenue, but we are not doing it with any client.",Pixels,
how does the cookie-agreement window affect the efficiency of our pixels? do they even work? ,"In legal terms, the pixels can't work if the cookie policy is not accepted by the user. We already see some cases where the pixels fire without accepting the cookie policy and we are the first ones warning the client, however, the client is the one who should manage it. ",Pixels,
Is it possible to have one pixel to track different ovjectives/KPIs ?!,"In most of the cases, the clients only want to implement image pixels. In this case 1 pixel = 1 event. If we have the opportunity to implement a universal pixel in all the depth of the landing, with some DSPs we can track various events from the DSP (ask for more info is you have this case).",Pixels,
In which case we need to ask for an update of the pixels already implemented ? ,"In the cases where we identify an error in the code shared with the client,  if we need to create the pixel again under another DSP advertiser or we need to use other DPS than before, so we need to implement the new pixel.",Pixels,
What are the common reason as to why the pixels do not fire correctly ? ,"In most cases, something happens on the client side. When we don't see the pixel firing correctly we need to check it with the client..",Pixels,
In which case we need to implement the pixels ? based on the KPI or always ? ,We need ot implement pixels if the objective of the campaign requires an action on the client' web page. Pixels are the only way we have to measure and optimise the event on the client's web.,Pixels,
How can we know what the consent rate is of a website?,"This info should be share by the clients, they can measure it in thei web site analytic tools.",Pixels,
"When it comes to pixel integration, we see necessities about data protection. Who would be the corresponding contact at Seedtag?",Contact performance supports of each market at implementation issues and legal team for data protection questions ,Pixels,
"As we need the pixels to fire after accepting cookies, do we have any guide on how to configure it?","Apart from the fact that they client should have their own trigger to fire the pixels after the cookie policy acceptance, there are multiple ways to do it and each client use their own triggers",Pixels,
Are we GDPR compliant? Is data shared/stored outside of the EU?,The integration of the pixels must be GDPR compliant from the client's side. But all DSPs we use have pixels GDPR compliant and the data collected in EU is stored in EU and the laws of the EU are the ones that protect the users.,Pixels,gdpr
"If the pixel of page visits has been already implemented in the landing page, do we need trackers being sent from client?","We always need the trackers to measure at least impressions and clicks by the client. Also, we can't track conversions if the pixels are implemented by publishers and we don't have trackers in our campaign. And if the pixels are implemented by default but we don't have trackers, we can trace our activity. So, yes, we need trackers.",Pixels,
Why do we need to set up daily reports? ,We need the daily report shared by the clients in every campaign we should optimise anything measured by them. The daily report is our main tool optimise the campaigns.,Reports,
How should the report be named?,"As clear as possible. For example: Brand_CountrySoldBy_CountryServe_Campaign'sName_More details if needed"". We receive a ton of daily reports in our folders and in some cases we can't find them. Please, remember to share the client's report name on the Jira tkt.",Reports,
How can we from adops check the data from the client? ,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TqvOrtEiP_mbD75CuqQ4SIic430e0KUvPV6NQlfA0rM/edit#gid=506268590,Reports,
In which cases we need the reports from the client ?!,We need the daily report shared by the clients in every campaign we should optimise anything measured by them. The daily report is our main tool optimise the campaigns.,Reports,
Could you link the client report to the Jira TKT in case we need to check it? (AdOps),pte review question,Reports,
Should we ask client which adserver do they have in case we need to build a datastudio for G4? ,"Looker studio is useful for GA4 only data. When we reach clients with adserver platrforms, they can easily send us the reports from these platforms",Reports,
"Should we ask for an internal report or should the Performance team provide it directly for the campaigns with other KPIs such as CPS, TOS, etc?","Asking in advance for the internal report explaining the metrics the client needs to view from our side, would be super helpful. By default, only internal reports are created when the objective is not delivery and we receive the client's report.",Reports,
Why is it not possible to share a sitelists including clicks per publisher?,"We use DV360 as a main DSP unlike Xandr Monetize/Curate/Invest, the inventory report doesn't show publishers, if not sites. However, since the perfomance campaigns are served in open with contextual strategies that apply to the site's content, we recommend not to share the list of sites. The inventory is not O&O.
",Reports,
When we need the report from adservers vs GA??,"The report from the adserver is needed if we should report the conversions using the conversions client's data and we have pixels implemented or they can share the info from their floodlights. And the report from GA is needed if we don't have pixels implemented but we need to report any event happening on the client's LP, or if instead and adserver the client uses GA as a principal analytics tool and we have urls+utms instead of click trackers.",Reports,
How can we know beforehand if the which GA the client is using? Sometimes we're able to work with the lookerstudio template and other times we are not,The client is the one who should share the info about the GA version that is using. We can use LookerStudio with GA4 (most of the clients are working now with it). With the old versions of GA we can't create an automated report in LookerStudio.,Reports,

What defines a âdelivery KPIâ versus an âengagement/cost efficiency KPIâ?,Delivery KPIs focus on volume and exposure: Impressions CTR (Click-through Rate) Viewability Engagement/Cost Efficiency KPIs evaluate user behavior after the click or cost-based performance: Time on Site (TOS) Bounce Rate New Users CPA (Cost per Acquisition) CPV (Cost per Visit) CPQV (Cost per Qualified Visit),Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
"What are the differences between Fixed CPC, dCPC, and dCPM?","Fixed CPC: Best for delivery-focused campaigns or when tracking/reporting capabilities are limited. dCPC: Ideal when we have post-click tracking (via floodlights or GA) and aim to optimize for performance. dCPM: Use when working with high-impact formats, or when where clicks are not the main focus.",Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
"Can we mix models (e.g., Max CPC for one strategy, Fixed for another)?","Generally no âcampaigns should follow one commercial model for consistency in buying logic and reporting. For hybrid needs, split across different IOs or flights.",Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
"Can we change pricing model during a campaign if we are not achieving goal KPI? (e.g., Fixed CPC to dCPC)","Yes, we can change buying model during campaign but this needs to be reviewed case by case with the trader. FLOODLIGHTS & TRACKING SETUP",Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
"What is a âfloodlight tag,â and why does Seedtag need to implement one?","A floodlight tag is a tracking tag, formerly called Pixel (commonly used in Campaign Manager 360 or DV360) that enables Seedtag to measure post-click or post-view activity on a clientâs site. It should always be implemented by default or as the universal tag
 We use it to: Attribute conversions and engagement to specific strategies Feed campaign signals into DSP algorithms for optimization Validate performance outcomes beyond CTR Clients using GTM (Google Tag Manager) often have simpler setups for floodlight implementation. Follow this",Brandformance Direct,Floodlights & Tracking
What happens if the client cannot implement Seedtagâs floodlight tag?,"If we canât implement the floodlight, we assess fallback options: UTMs split by strategy and size Google Analytics (GA4) or Adobe Analytics with clear segmentation
 If none of these are feasible, we default to Fixed CPC, as optimization becomes very limited.",Brandformance Direct,Floodlights & Tracking
Can a floodlight track multiple KPIs or events?,"Only if implemented as a universal tag with custom triggers. In most cases, 1 floodlight = 1 conversion event. For more granular tracking, multiple floodlights should be defined per event.",Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
What does âtrackings by strategyâ mean?,"It means tracking performance independently for each contextual strategy. Strategies may include: Intention-based targeting Contextual Search (SERP URL-based) Data-driven keyword clusters (offensive, defensive, generic) Re-engagement or retargeting modules Each must be clearly labeled (UTMs or ad group naming) and trackable through analytics or campaign reporting.",Brandformance Direct,Floodlights & Tracking
How many trackers are recommended?,"We recommend at least one per strategy (8 if we do retargeting):kws def kws off kws gen page category discovery / intention contextual search rtg 1 rtg 2 Fewer may be acceptable for basic delivery goals, but performance optimization requires granularity. Note: If we are using multiple creatives, we need 8 trackers per creative",Brandformance Direct,Floodlights & Tracking
Is it mandatory to receive trackers per strategy?,"Not mandatory, but essential when: Campaigns are evaluated using client-side analytics (GA, adservers) Strategy-level optimization is required We need to track performance across multiple dimensions (size, format, geo) REPORTING REQUIREMENTS",Brandformance Direct,Floodlights & Tracking
What qualifies as a âdaily client report from analytics platformâ?,"To qualify, reports must:Be delivered daily Include performance breakdowns by tracking (strategy), date and device Come from platforms such as GA4, Adobe Analytics, Adserver etc. Show post-click metrics like TOS, bounce rate, conversions, or new sessions Hereâs a to set up the reporting on GA$ and Adserver. If the client can provide this and performance is measurable per strategy, we can offer dCPC or dCPM models.",Brandformance Direct,Reporting Requirements
Why do we need daily reports from clients?,"It helps us align with the clientâs ""source of truth"" Essential to validate post-click KPIs and compare DSP vs client data Key requirement to optimize within the clientâs business logic",Brandformance Direct,Reporting Requirements
What happens if there is no reporting or tracking capability?,"We default to a Fixed CPC model. This ensures cost predictability and allows campaign delivery, even without optimization levers. DSP & INVENTORY CONSIDERATIONS",Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
What can we optimize in the DSP?,"If tracking is robust, we can optimize by: Device Contextual strategy Site/Domain Exchange Geo (region, city, postal code) Time of day or day of week Creative or size If we only have aggregate data or basic KPIs, our optimization potential is limited. FALLBACK SCENARIOS",Brandformance Direct,Floodlights & Tracking
Whatâs the fallback logic if core elements are missing?,If any of the following are not available: No floodlight or pixel tracking No strategy-level UTMs or trackers No daily client-side report Then Fixed CPC is the only viable model.,Brandformance Direct,Fallback Scenarios
What should I do if the client requests mixed objectives across one campaign?,"Split the brief into two flights or IOs with separate KPIs and buying models. This ensures transparency, clarity, and operational feasibility.",Brandformance Direct,KPI & Model Selection
Whatâs the difference between Managed (Direct IO) and Programmatic campaigns?,"Managed: Seedtag handles all campaign setup, targeting, optimization, and reporting. Ideal for clients wanting support across the entire funnel. Programmatic: The advertiser runs the campaign via their own DSP/trading desk. Seedtag provides curated inventory and targeting segments, but optimization is owned by the advertiser.",Managed vs Programmatic,Campaign Structure & Strategy
Why do we optimize branding campaigns in Programmatic?,"While performance campaigns are optimized by the advertiser, branding campaigns still benefit from Seedtagâs quality assurance layer. We: Exclude poor-performing domains Monitor engagement metrics Ensure high-impact placements for better awareness This light optimization ensures brand-safe, effective delivery.",Managed vs Programmatic,Optimization
When should we recommend Managed vs Programmatic?,"Choose Managed when: The client wants full KPI alignment, campaign support, and Seedtag-optimized outcomes. Choose Programmatic when: The client prefers to use their DSP, controls optimization, and seeks access to our curated inventory and segments.

Are Flood lights and trackers the same ?,"loodlights and trackers are NOT the same thing. They serve different primary purposes in campaign measurement and optimization.

Here's a breakdown of each:

Floodlights:

Purpose: Floodlights are the conversion tracking system within the Google Marketing Platform (which includes DV360 and Campaign Manager 360). They are used to track and report on specific actions (conversions) that users take after interacting with your ads, such as: 
Purchases
Sign-ups
Website visits to specific pages
Form submissions
Downloads
Mechanism: A Floodlight activity is a snippet of HTML or JavaScript code (a tag) that you place on your website's conversion pages. When a user completes the desired action after seeing or clicking your ad, the Floodlight tag fires and records the conversion in the Google Marketing Platform.

Key Functionality:
Conversion Counting: Accurately measures the number of conversions based on different counting methods (e.g., standard, unique, per session).
Attribution: Helps attribute conversions to specific ads, campaigns, and other marketing channels.
Audience Building: Enables the creation of remarketing audiences based on users who have completed specific Floodlight activities.
Sales Tracking: Sales activities can track the monetary value and number of items purchased during a transaction.
Management: Floodlight activities are typically created and managed within Campaign Manager 360 and then are available for use in DV360.
Trackers:

Purpose: In DV360, ""trackers"" is a more general term that refers to various types of URLs or tags used to monitor and gather data about ad delivery and user interactions. They are broader than just conversion tracking.
Types of Trackers in DV360:
Click Trackers: These URLs track when a user clicks on your ad. They often redirect through a DV360 server before landing on the final destination URL, allowing DV360 to record the click.
Impression Trackers: These are often 1x1 pixel images (or code snippets) that are loaded when your ad is displayed. They allow you to count and verify ad impressions.
Viewability Trackers: These scripts measure whether an ad was actually seen by a user according to industry standards (e.g., 50% of the ad visible for at least 1 second for display, 2 seconds for video).
Third-Party Trackers: DV360 allows the implementation of trackers from third-party vendors for various measurement and verification purposes.
Key Functionality:
Ad Verification: Ensuring ads are served on the intended placements and are viewable.
Click and Impression Counting: Basic metrics for campaign performance.
Audience Measurement: Some trackers can contribute to audience insights but are not primarily for building remarketing lists in the same way as Floodlights.
Brand Safety: Some third-party trackers help ensure ads appear in brand-safe environments.
Management: Trackers are often set up at the advertiser, campaign, or ad level within the DV360 interface.",Floodlight,"Tracking, Measurement"
How many floodlights should i share with the client for implementation and which event will they track ?,"You'll need one Floodlight tag per distinct conversion event you want to track on your client's website (e.g., purchases, sign-ups, form submissions).

Share the following with your client for each Floodlight:

Floodlight Tag Code: The HTML or JavaScript snippet.
Placement Instructions: The specific webpage where the tag needs to be implemented (e.g., order confirmation page).
Firing Logic: When the tag should fire (e.g., upon successful completion of the action).
Dynamic Parameter Instructions (for Sales): How to populate transaction-specific data (order ID, revenue, etc.).
The number of tags depends on the number of different conversion actions you need to measure.",Floodlight,"Tracking, Measurement"
